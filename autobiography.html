                    <h2>About Myself:</h2>
                    <p>I developed a passion for coding, ironically as a senior in high school. 
                        I love the excitement of the challenge, the chance to be creative, collaborate, 
                        and having the ability to bring the abstract imaginations of my thought into the realm of reality! 
                        I am a "why" thinker; I have to know the "whys" behind everything I aspire to know, simply because I love learning and being able to fully comprehend and grasp new things;
                        everything from martial arts, to financial aid and taxes, to programming! I am currently well on the road to becoming a Full Stack Java Developer by becoming ever proficient in HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, PHP, C#, Java, and SQL. 
                        I will admit, I have not mastered any of these languages; I am a 3rd degree black belt in the martial art of Tae Kwon Do and dare to say that I have mastered it. However, I aspire to give it my all, for the goal of achieving success 
                        for that which is greater than myself; for my family, friends, future wife and children to come, and my ever surrounding neighbor that is all mankind.</p>
                    <p>My name is Matthew Wright. I graduated from Adairsville High School as an Honors Graduate in 2017, and am now a Sophomore at Chattahoochee Technical College, majoring in Computer Programming/ Software Engineering.</p>
                    <p>My previous occupations include instructing Tae Kwon Do at Won's Tae Kwon Do Education and maintaining and operating up to 240 twisting machines at Southern Yarn Dyers. I currently am employed at Chattahoochee Technical College,
                        working in the Financial Aid Office, handling highly sensitive student data, maintaining student files, and answering client inquiries in person and over the phone.</p>
                    <p>Through these experiences I have developed essential skills necessary to be a successful leader; persevering through difficulties, loving the challenge and the opportunity to grow through the process.</p>

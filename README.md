# MyPortfolioWebsite
My protfolio website, which can now be found at: "www.matthewleewright.com" or "matthewleewright.com" I developed my portfolio website completly from scratch with HTML5, CSS3, and a bit of JQueryUI API. When developing this application I initially developed the entire application inside of Notepade++ for the purpose of practice while learning with minimal help from an IDE.
